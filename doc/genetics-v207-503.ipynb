    "The genetics variance $\\sigma_a^2$ is supposed that of the base population, where everybody is independent. To understand this, suppose that only offspring of one pair of parents are in the next generation. Then there are only the Medelian sampling errors of the parents left in the 2nd generation, which is $\\frac{\\sigma_a^2}{2}$. Generally speaking, because of the relationship among the offspring, and between generations, there is a loss of $\\hat{\\sigma_a^2}$ if we use the whole population to estimate it. It also varies due to pedigree structures. Hence it is not a good idea to use full pedigree to estimate $\\sigma_a^2$."
