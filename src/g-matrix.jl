method I.  Note **`Z`** here is ID column majored.

`G = Z`Z/2Î£p_i(1-p_i)`

where **`Z`** contains the marker genotypes for all animals at all loci, corrected for 
the allele frequency per locus, and `p_i` is the frequency of the allele at locus 
*i* coded with the highest integer value.  **`Z`** is derived from the genotypes of the 
animals by subtracting 2 times the allele frequency, that is `2p_i`, from matrix 
**`X`**, which specifies the marker genotypes for each individual as 0, 1 or 2. Values 
for `p_i` are calculated from the data (default), or can be specified in a file by 
the user.

Pass copy(GT) to this function to avoid GT matrix modification.
