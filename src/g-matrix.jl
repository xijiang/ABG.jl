where **`Z`** contains the marker genotypes for all animals at all loci, corrected for 
the allele frequency per locus, and `p_i` is the frequency of the allele at locus 
*i* coded with the highest integer value.  **`Z`** is derived from the genotypes of the 
animals by subtracting 2 times the allele frequency, that is `2p_i`, from matrix 
**`X`**, which specifies the marker genotypes for each individual as 0, 1 or 2. Values 
for `p_i` are calculated from the data (default), or can be specified in a file by 
the user.

Pass copy(GT) to this function to avoid GT matrix modification.

# Introduciton
This procedure is to calculate G-matrix with HD genotypes, where N_id << N_locus.

# Data preparation
The genotypes can be prepared from plink.bed.  A small c++ program `raw2gt` is also
available with this package.

```bash
plink --cow --bfile data.bed --recode A --out target # produce target.raw
cat target.raw | raw2gt > raw.gt
```

# Example
`ABG.big_G("raw.gt", target, 10, 12)`

- **`raw.gt`** is the file prepared above
- **`target`** e.g., `target.G` is the calculation results
- **`10`**, is the amount of memory to be used in `gigabytes`. This amount is to hold two genotype blocks.
  The program won't use more than 4/5 of available machine memory.
- **`12`**: Number of threads to be used. 

This program uses vanRaden method I.
